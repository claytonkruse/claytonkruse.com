<h3>Univeristy Education at Mizzou</h3>
<p>
	On my first day of class at Mizzou, I walked into CS 1050, sat down, and was
	bewildered by how basic the material was. After the class ended, I immediately
	contacted my Academic Advisor and asked him about potentially skipping the
	class for something more advanced. He informed me of a policy that would allow
	me to skip, and get credit for CS 1050, so long as I could get above a B in
	the more advanced class, CS 2050. It's now the spring semester, and I have
	successfully recieved credit for both CS 1050 and 2050 with a cumulative GPA
	of 3.44 for the fall semester.

<h2>Related Projects and Hobbies</h2>
<p>
	I started programing games on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> in
	elementary school. Inspired to program at an early age, I continued on to create
	numerous projects on the platform that far exceeded Scratch's scope. I did all
	of my programming in Scratch until I moved on in middle school.
</p>
<p>
	In middle school, I spent a lot of time working with JavaScript and Node.JS.
	First, I made a basic realtime updating chat application with <a
		href="https://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a
	>
	and <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>. I contiuned on to make an
	online multiplayer browser game using the same libraries, hosted on
	<a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. At some point during middle
	school I was also running a small flash games website that was used by many
	students in the school. I also began hosting a Minecraft server that is still
	online to this day.
</p>
<p>
	In high school, I created a Discord bot via <a href="https://discord.js.org/"
		>Discord.JS</a
	>. This bot also included a frontend written in
	<a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> and had persistent functionality that I
	achieved with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>. I also wrote
	HTML proxies from scratch, before I realized there are easier solutions to
	bypass a blocklist.
</p>
<p>
	I also made the swtich from Windows to Unix like operating systems in high
	school. I fiddled around with different Linux distrobutions until I settled on <a
		href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a
	>. I also run some Linux boxes at home, which I use for
	<a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> and as a NAS.
</p>
<p>
	In college, so far I have been working on multiple web applications in <a
		href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a
	>. These applications have
	<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>
	and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> databases that I
	interact with through <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>. These
	applications also include authentication functionality that I initally wrote
	myself; however, I have migrated to
	<a href="https://lucia-auth.com/">Lucia</a>.
</p>

<h2>Experience as an Employee</h2>
<p>I have been formally employed by buisnesses on two seperate occasions.</p>
<p>
	My first job was working part time at Dairy Queen in the back, which was known
	as the grill. I prepared all the hot food at that location. My reponsiblietes
	included managing a grill, multiple fryers, multiple microwaves, two ovens,
	and the freezer. I always worked the closing shift, so at the end of the
	night, I would do all the dishes, clean the grill and the fryers, take the
	grease out back behind the dumpster and pour it into the receptical, clean all
	surfaces including the insides of the microwaves, take out the trash, and
	finally mop the floors.
</p>
<p>
	My second job was working full time at Dierbergs in the Deli department. This
	job was much the same as working at Dairy Queen. Both jobs had lots of hard
	work preparing food, cleaning, and working the closing shift. The difference
	with Dierbergs was that I was now working full time, and in a position where I
	had to both provide customer service, and functionally work as a team with my
	co-workers, which was in stark contrast to the solitude of Dairy Queen. During
	my time at Dierbergs, I was also in charge of training new part-time hires.
